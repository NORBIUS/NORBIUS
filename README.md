- 👋 Hi, I’m @NORBIUS
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis, data governance, and process improvement from a skills perspective. Personally, I love listening to music, drawing, and I'm a hobbyist with interests in photography, woodworking, and computers.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that force me to think deeply and apply the skills I'm being taught
- 📫 You can reach me at norbius@me.com
